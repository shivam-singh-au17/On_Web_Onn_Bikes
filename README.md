# Challenges -
<h5>1. Communication
Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp.</h5>
<h5>2. Collaboration
As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier. <br> <br>
These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player.</h5>


# Conclusion -
* I would like to thank, all of my team members, **Hema Shyamala**, **Nikhil Joshi**, and **Ananthu Asokkumar** for their contribution. The first day, after getting the project, we thought, it was impossible for us, but <br>
* **Everything is impossible, until it is done…** <br>
* I’m feeling very proud to get such hard-working team members and also feeling very fortunate for being a part of **Masai School**.
